# Project 6
IEEE OPS 2015-16, 6th project

Project 6 was the last individual project part of the UCLA IEEE OPS curriculum. In this project, we designed PCBs using Eagle CAD Software to create distance sensors with an IR LED and receiver. Then, we programmed a Teensy LC to convert the distance readings into a brightness level for the corresponding LEDs. We also worked on our soldering skills by constructing a perfboard for our circuit.
